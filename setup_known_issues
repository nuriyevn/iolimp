1. The files (symbolic links) in the CGI-BIN-DIR cannot be modified neither with chmod nor with chown.
Only copying from /opt/ejudge/libexec/ejudge/cgi-bin helps

MUST DO THIS:

 # cd CGI_BIN_DIR
 # rm -rf new-* judge master register serve-control team users
 # cp EJUDGE_PREFIX/libexec/ejudge/cgi-bin/* ./
 
 ALSO must copy:
 # cp -PR EJUDGE_PREFIX/share/ejudge/style/* /var/www/html/<domain-name>/ejudge
